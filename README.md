# IBM Data Science Capstone Project: Predicting Falcon 9 First Stage Landing

Welcome to the IBM Data Science Capstone Project repository. In this project, we aim to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. SpaceX, known for its innovative rocket launches, offers the Falcon 9 at a significantly lower cost compared to other providers. This cost reduction is made possible by SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. By accurately predicting whether the first stage will land successfully, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be valuable for alternate companies competing with SpaceX for rocket launch contracts.

## Contents
This repository contains the following components:

**1. Getting data using the API:** This section focuses on retrieving data using the API.\
**2. Web scraping data from the Wikipedia site and data wrangling:** Here, we scrape relevant data from the Wikipedia site and perform data wrangling to prepare it for analysis.
**3.Data processing, key indicators, and metrics:** In this section, we process the dataset, derive key indicators and metrics, and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering.
**4.Location analysis and dashboard:** We work with maps to perform location analysis and create a dashboard to visualize the results.
**5. ML algorithm selection and evaluation:** Various machine learning algorithms are analyzed and evaluated to identify the best one for our data.
